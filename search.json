I am now writing this note book for better understanding since there exist a mass of concepts. At the same time I hope this note help my future employment. lecture 1 - Basic OO Concept1.obeject-oriented programming is founded on these ideas: Abstraction: Simple things like objects represent more complex underlying code and data Encapsulation: The ability to protect some components of the object from external access Inheritance: The ability for a class(“subclass”) to extend or override functionality or another class(“superclass”) Polymorphism: The provision(提供) of a single interface to entities of different types. It has two types. Method overriding: Compile time polymorphism. Methods with same class name, input and parameters appear in both super class and subclass. Method overloading: Run time polymorphism. Methods in same class have same name but different in parameters. 2.Public and PrivateAccess rules, 还有protected等. declear as public: constructors, methods and static constants declear as private: helper method(needed only inside the class), fields 3.Accessors and Modifiers Accessors(getters): xxx.get(), method that return values of private fields. Modifiers(setters&#x2F;mutators): xxx.set(), method that set values of private fields. 4.EncapsulationEncapsulation即“stop other changing it” Hiding the impilmentation details of a class is called encapsulation Encapsulation helps with program maintenance: a change in class does not affect other classes A client of a class interacts with the class only through well-documented public constructors and methods; this facilitates team development 5.The keyword “this”“this“ refers to the implicit parameter inside your class. It can refer to a field this.field or call a method this.method(parameters). Can also be used in constructor(this化身变成Constructors，见下文). 6.ConstructorsThe constructor method is a special method of a class for creating object instances of that class. 可以有多个，但不能同参: If a class has more than one constructor, they must have different numbers and&#x2F;or types of parameters (constructor overloading) Constructors are invoked using the operator new. ★Constructors of a class can call each other using the keyword “this” (referred to as constructor chaining) - a good way to avoid duplicating code lecture 2 - More Advanced Java TopicsPassing by Value &amp; Passing by Referencecao"},{"title":"I'm not WNB","date":"2024-01-07T00:48:53.000Z","url":"/2024/01/07/My-New-Post/","tags":[["test","/tags/test/"]],"categories":[["开发日志","/categories/%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E6%97%A5%E5%BF%97/"]],"content":"测试笔记。现在是格林威治时间 2024年1月7日，0点51分。 差不多该睡觉了，但现在小破华为突然开始播放MJ的Beat it， emmmmmmmm，exciting！ 顺便测试一些东西代码显示 简单的C语言hello world示范 内容折叠 这是一条折叠内容 你怎么能打开它不要啦！快点拉上！！！ 还不赶快拉上！ 提示面板 面板框的标题 公开处刑1号公开处刑2号 其中TYPE可以是success&#x2F;danger&#x2F;info&#x2F;warning 提示信息真的有人会看吗 应该会有人吧，，， 万一真的没有呢Σ(っ °Д °;)っ 不，一定会有人的(・∀・(・∀・(・∀・*) 别看了，说的就是你 模糊字面我不知道你能不能看得清这些东西 "},{"title":"Hello World","date":"2024-01-07T00:01:47.953Z","url":"/2024/01/07/hello-world/","categories":[["undefined",""]],"content":"Welcome to Hexo!
