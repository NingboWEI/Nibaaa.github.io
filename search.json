I am now writing this note book for better understanding since there exist a mass of concepts. At the same time I hope this note help my future employment. lecture 1 - Basic OO Concept1.obeject-oriented programming is founded on these ideas: Abstraction: Simple things like objects represent more complex underlying code and data Encapsulation: The ability to protect some components of the object from external access Inheritance: The ability for a class(“subclass”) to extend or override functionality or another class(“superclass”) Polymorphism: The provision(提供) of a single interface to entities of different types. It has two types. Method overriding: Compile time polymorphism. Methods with same class name, input and parameters appear in both super class and subclass. Method overloading: Run time polymorphism. Methods in same class have same name but different in parameters. 2.Public and PrivateAccess rules, 还有protected等. declear as public: constructors, methods and static constants declear as private: helper method(needed only inside the class), fields 3.Accessors and Modifiers Accessors(getters): xxx.get(), method that return values of private fields. Modifiers(setters&#x2F;mutators): xxx.set(), method that set values of private fields. 4.EncapsulationEncapsulation即“stop other changing it” Hiding the impilmentation details of a class is called encapsulation Encapsulation helps with program maintenance: a change in class does not affect other classes A client of a class interacts with the class only through well-documented public constructors and methods; this facilitates team development 5.The keyword “this”“this“ refers to the implicit parameter inside your class. It can refer to a field this.field or call a method this.method(parameters). Can also be used in constructor(this化身变成Constructors，见下文). 6.ConstructorsThe constructor method is a special method of a class for creating object instances of that class. 可以有多个，但不能同参: If a class has more than one constructor, they must have different numbers and&#x2F;or types of parameters (constructor overloading) Constructors are invoked using the operator new. ★Constructors of a class can call each other using the keyword “this” (referred to as constructor chaining) - a good way to avoid duplicating code lecture 2 - More Advanced Java Topics1.Passing by Value &amp; Passing by Reference在java中，data is always passed by value(including object reference, in other word the pointer)!!! Passing by value constitutes copying of data, where changes to the copied value are not reflected in the original value Passing by reference constitutes(构成) the aliasing(别名) of data, where changes to the aliased value are reflected in the original value(in java, object references(pointer) are passed by value) 2.Static Fields &amp; Static Methods2.1 Static Fields: A static field (class field or class variable) is shared by all objects of the class A non-static field (instance field or instance variable) belongs to an individualobject Modifying a Static Field Affects All Instances Usually static fields are NOT initialised in constructors; they are initialised either in declarations or in public static methods or just use their default value 2.2 Static Methods Static methods can access and manipulate(操纵) class’s static fields. They belong to the class - not an instance of it Note that static methods cannot access instance fields or call instance methods of the class while instance methods can access all fields and call all methods of their class - both static and non-static(I have suffered a lot from the snake game cw) 3.Java Collections FrameworkJava collection Framework(JCF) is a set of classes and interface in java, provided for storing and processing collections of data. It is a part of the java.util package.可理解为java语言中的数据结构包 API&library API stands for: Application Programming Interface. Difference between a library and an API: An API is an interface or communication protocol between a client and a server, intended to simplify the building of client-side software. A library contains re-usable chunks(大块) of code. A collection is an object that repersents a group of objects.Core collection framework interface: Iterable: Represents an iterator object Collection: Represents a dynamic group of objects (elements) Map: Maps keys to values; no duplicate keys(eg.HasMap) Queue: Represents FIFO queues or LIFO stacks Deque: Represents a double ended queue Set: A collection that cannot contain duplicate elements(eg.HashSet, TreeSet) List: An ordered sequence of elements that allows duplicate elements(eg.ArrayList, LinkedList) following is about implementation of object oriented concepts in java 4. Aggregation and Compositionthey both have “has-a” relationship What is the difference between the Aggregations and Compositions? answer comes from GPT: 生命周期的依赖性： 聚合（Aggregation）：在聚合关系中，子对象可以独立于父对象存在。父对象的创建和销毁不会影响子对象的生命周期。 组合（Composition）：在组合关系中，子对象的生命周期完全依赖于父对象。当父对象被销毁时，子对象也会随之被销毁。 所有权： 聚合：表示一种较弱的关系。子对象可以被多个父对象共享或关联。 组合：表示一种更强的关系。子对象严格属于一个父对象，并且通常不与其他父对象共享 answer from slids: In Aggregation, The object exists outside the other, is created outside, so it is passed as an argument In Composition, The object only exists, or only makes sense inside the other, as a part of the other 4.1 Aggregation in java An object of class B is part of an object of class A (semantically) but the object of class B can be shared and if the object of class A is deleted, the object of class B is not deleted. 4.2 Composition in java An object of class A owns an object of class B and the object of class B cannot beshared and if the object of class A is deleted, the object of class B is also deleted 5.Inheritance &amp; Polymorphism What is inheritance and why do we use it? answer comes from slids: Inheritance: Forming new classes based on existing ones Superclass: Parent class being extended Subclass: Child class that inherits behaviour from the parent class “Is-A” relationship What is the difference between polymorphism, method overloading, and method overriding? answer comes from slids: Polymorphism Polymorphism is an object oriented concept Method overloading and method overriding are two forms of polymorphism Method overloading Methods with same the name co-exists in the same class but they must have different method signature (number&#x2F;type of parameters – think about constructors) Resolved during compile time (static binding) Method overriding Method with the same name is declared in super and sub class (think about the bike1.currentState() example from labsheet 1) Resolved during runtime 6.Abstract Methods &amp; Classes, InterfaceUsually abstract class(eg.animal) implement an interface(eg.Maintainable), and the abstract class get Inheritanced from other classes(eg.reptile). The abstract methods in abstract class(or it should be called superclass) and methods in interface can be overrided in subclass. What is the difference between an abstract class and interface in Java? answer comes from slids: Java abstract class Can have instance methods that implement a default behaviour(可以同时有abstract method和instance method) May contain non-final variables Java interfaces Methods are implicitly(含蓄地) abstract and most cannot have implementations(无instance method) Variables declared are by default static and final 7.Java Releasethe history of java release from java8-java21 can be checked at  8.refactoring code Improved Code Quality Enhanced Readability Reduced Code Duplication Maintainability Scalability Performance Optimisation 9.Basic Maintenance Goal: Improving current code without creating new functionality Keep the code well organised and easy to maintain in the future Examples (see also Lecture 1A) Adding unit tests Renaming Packaging Avoiding code duplication Comments and documentation Moving code to where it belongs Using correct access modifiers (encapsulation) lecture 3 - Introduction to GUI programming in Java1.Graphical User Interfaces(GUI) GUIs are a form of user interface that allow users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons […] as primary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation. GUIs are event-driven, the user decides the order of execution depending whether they click a button, or select adrop-down, or choose a menu item etc.The system is waiting for something to happen Guiding principles for designing high quality GUIs? Keep it simple Create consistency and use common elements Be purposeful in page layout Strategically use colour and texture Use typography to create hierarchy and clarity Make sure that the system communicates what’s happening Think about the defaults 2.Basics of GUI programming-Swing&amp;Javafx Swing is java’s first attempt at a modern GUI apporach. it came about in late 1990s. Swing is built on the AWT(Abstract Window Toolkit) Swing is being slowly retired in favour of JavaFX, following are hello word for javafx. 3.getting started with Javafxjavafx consists of stage, scence and node Stage: Think of it as an application window. Depending on OS, there may be only one. Equivalent to Swing’s JFrame (or JDialog) Scence: Equivalent to a content pane. Holds other objects (JavaFX Node objects)In other word, if the application is a play. The whole play contains several Scence, at the same time all the action scence take place on a Stage. Node are some element in the scence. 3.1 Adding simple 2D Graphics can change Pane to StackPane making the line staying at middle. Except Pane and StackPane, there are other built-in layout panes in javafx. eg.vbox,gridpane,Hbox and AnchorPane…. 4.MVC pattern and FXMLMVC stands for Model-View-Controller. View tells controller what happened Controller inform the model what to do Views catches relevant notifications and updates 5.FXMLSo far we build GUI in code. But if the GUI is going to get compilcated, Javafx supports describing the layout using FXML(in fx markup language). We can use Scence builder to creat fxml file graphically. Why use FXML? What do people think are the benefits? UI designers might not be programmers The designers can use external software (such as Scene Builder) to design the look of the UI whilst the programmers can build the functionality FXML glues the two aspects together Building GUIs visually rather than programmatically makes intuitive sense Event handling is simplified We can test&#x2F;fix application logic without touching the GUI design or vice versa 6.Multiple Windows in Javafxjavafx use setScence() to swith scence, which makes user get different windows. lecture 4 - OO analysis and UML1.UML overviewUML:” A specification defining a graphical language for visualizing, specifying, constructuing and documenting the artifacts of distributed object systems.” Advantages of using UML Enhances communication and ensures the right communication Captures the logical software architecture independent of the implementation language Helps to manage the complexity Abstraction Enables reuse of design Use Case Driven process is used in OO project. 2.Use Case DiagramsUse cases diagram describe a set of actions that some system or systems should or can perform in collaboration with one or more external users of the system or systemsUse case diagram components: Actors: Entities that interface with the system Can be people or other systems Use cases: Based on user stories Represent what the actor wants your system to do for them In the use case diagram only the use case name is represented In a use case specification each use case is formally described Subjext(system boundary) Classifier representing a business, software system, physical system or device under analysis, design, or consideration Relationship Relationship between use case and actor: Association indicates which actor initiates which use case Relationship between two use cases: Specifying common functionality and simplifying use case flows. Using &lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt;extend&gt;&gt; difference between include and extend include are used when multiple use cases share a piece of same functionality.即big action后面的small action, 箭头指向small one. extend used when activities might be performed as part of another activity but are not mandatory for a use case to run successfully. 即part of optional action, 箭头指向大的 3.Use Case Specification看不懂，先跳过 4.Activity DiagramsActivity Diagrams representations of workflows of stepwise activities and actions related to an individual use case or across many use cases. Its’ components: Activity: A state that is left once the activity is finished Activity edge: Transition that fires when previous activity completes Synchronisation bar: Describes the co-ordination of activities Decision diamond: Used to show decisions Start and stop marker: Used to define entry and exit points Swim lane: A way to group activities performed by the same actor on an activity diagram or to group activities in a single thread 5.Sequence Diagrams:Sequence diagrams are a temporal representation of objects and their interactions 6.Stat machine Diagrams:Stat machine Diagrams shows the possible states of a single object, the events or messages that cause a transition from one state to another, and the action that result from that state change 7.Class DiagramsA class diagrams shows the existence of classes and their structures and relationships in the logical view of a system It has Following components: Classes(name+attributes+operations) Class relationships Multiplicity indicators: Number of links between each instance of the source class and instances of the target class(1; ; 0..; 1..*; 3..7) relationships: Realisation实现关系: a specialised abstraction relationship between two sets of model elements, one representing a specification (the supplier) and the other representing an implementation (the client) of the specification 有implements关键词，指向interface，—– + 空心菱形 Generalisation泛化关系/&quot;is a&quot;: A directed relationship between a more general classifier (superclass) and a more specific classifier (subclass) 有extend关键词，指向superclass，———— + 空心菱形 Dependency依赖关系: you may invoke one of the APIs of the received class reference and any modification to that class may break your class as well 作为变量&#x2F;返回值应用，指向原本class Association关联关系: Class A holds a class level reference to class B Aggregation聚集关系/&quot;is part of&quot;: used when an object logically or physically contains another Composition组合关系: class B is composed by class A, class A instance owns the creation or controls lifetime of instance of class B 8.built tools built tools helps reduce errors from manually running steps increases the consistency of the process manage the dependencies keep a build log and allow better maintenance automatied testing… We have mentioned Maven and Gradle. built tool 1 - Maven manage dependencies and other settings in a POM (project object model) file, which base on xml. built tool 2 - Gradle Replaces XML in favour of a domain specific language groovy the offical build system for android lecture 5 - GUI-javafx adcances1.ImageView 2.CheckBox 3.ComboBox 4.MeunBarplease search online 5.Alert 6.About stylingcan change the theme by using css (Cascading Style Sheet) the css file can get referenced by using scene.getStylesheets() in java file. 7.JavaFX Application Thread JavaFX launches the UI on a JavaFX Application thread This thread should be left handling the UI interaction, while other thread do heavy computation to prvent freezing. Use javafx.concurrent pakage to make javafx creat and communicate with other threads. 8.Animation in JavaFXTypes of animations in Javafx: Timeline Animation Transition Animation Path Animation… Key concepts for Timeline Animation Timeline: Denotes the progression of time during animation with an associated key frame at a giveninstance Key Frame: Represents the state of the node being animated at a specific instant on the timeline Key Value: Represents the value of a property of a node along with an interpolator to be use Interpolator: By default linear; changes the property being animated linearly with time. (except LINEAR线性, it can also be EASE IN缓入, EASE OUT缓出, BOUNCE弹性, SPRING…) an example of animation form my cw, this makes a lable change its size with time. lecture 6 - Coding and Repository Tools for DMS1.Use of git commit is a atomic operation(要么完全发生要么不发生) 2.Coding Convention legible software contain fewer bugs, more legible software is more flexible and encourages reuse. This include Bob’s coding convention and Java Coding Conventions from Sun Microsystems Bob’s Rule 1 - Method Length (75 lines or less)Rule 2 - Indentation缩进(less than 5 levels)Rule 3 - Line Length below 80 charactersRule 4 - Class Variable NamesRule 5 - Accessor Methods Enforce encapsulation please define them at the “top” of the file, since they are most common to use. Rule 6 - Class Variables Keeping class variables private enforces encapsulation. Rule 7 - Method Naming Private method lower-case begin, Public mrthod Upper-case begin. Rule 8 - Method Parameters (less than 5)Rule 9 - Symbolic Constants Do not use numbers in your code, but rather symbolic constants. xx + xx &#x3D; 255 –&gt; xx + xx &#x3D; MAX_ALPHA 3.Javadoc Documentation Describe what you are commenting about simmiler to in-line comment, but in class or higher level. lecture 7 - OO Software Design principles &amp; Patterns Why OOD Principles and Patterns Software development specifications keep changing constantly Software need to be smart enought to cope easy to maintain easy to extend Following systematically conventions(惯例) so others can also maintain your code. SOLID Principles Object Oriented Design Principles for Clean Coders. This could help us to develop our code sense. 1.S-Single Responsibility Principle A class&#x2F;method should have one and only one responsibility 2.O-Open-Closed Principle Software entities(classes, modules, functions…) should be open for extension, but closed for modification Abstraction and override is a key 3.L-Liskov’s Substitution Principle Subtypes must be substitutable(替代物) for their base types This is just a way of ensuring that inheritance is used correctly(保证inheritance类的一致性) 4.I-Interface Segregation Principle Client should bot be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use. an extension of the single responsibility principle. Fat interfaces should be broken down. 5.D-Dependency Inversion Principle “High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. Dependency inversion is a generalisation for the Open-Close and Liskov Substitution Principles Design Patterns &amp; Examples A pattern provides an abstract description of a design problem and how a general arrangement of elements solves it Design patterns are organised in two ways: Purpose: Creational: Concern the process of object creation. Structural: Deal with the composition of classes and objects. Behavioural: Characterise the way in which classes and objects interact anddistribute responsibility. Scope: Class: These patterns deal with relationships between classes and sub-classes (which are fixed at compile time) Object: Deal with object relationships (which can be changed at runtime) 1.The Singleton Pattern Create a one of a kind object for which there is only one instance Use static method and private classes to ensure only one instance and able to providing a global point of access to it. However Singleton have problem in concurrent request, threading, interfacing with subclasses… 2.The Factory Pattern Creational patterns which abstract the object instantiation process. They hide how objects are created and help make the overall system independent of how its objects are created. There are also Abstract Factories, a factory of factories. 3.Adapter Pattern(Structural) This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to join functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces.允许不兼容的接口一起工作 4.Observer Pattern Observer pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified, its dependent objects are to be notified automatically. It consists of two roal: Subject + Observer lecture 8 - Refactoring Legacy Code maintenance is the core of software enginering.(legacy code即旧版本老代码) 1.Identify Code Smell（代码异味）Code smells because it is hard to undersdand, not because it is incorrect. Here are some examples: Duplicated Code: it is bad because if you modify one instance duplicated code but not the others, you may have introduces a bug Long Method&#x2F;Class: long method are more difficult to understand, reduce cohesion Long Parameter Lists: hard to undrsatand, can become inconsistent and Lazy Class, Temporary Field, Data Class…. 2.Refactoring codeRefactoring means modiy the exisiting code making it easy to read, maintance, more efficient…Refactoring reduces repetition and helps focus on objects 2.1.Encapsulate Fields to retain private variables Un-encapsulated data是对OOP的一种违背(violation) 要合理的使用get和set 可以Encapsulating Fields Automatically With IDEs 2.2.Extract(提取) method from a large block of code Short, well named methods are easier to maintain can Create a new method to perform the extract method 3.Applying a design pattern in Refactoring lecture 9 - Open Source1.Liabrary2.open source software development and maintenance3.Licences"},{"title":"I'm not WNB","date":"2024-01-07T00:48:53.000Z","url":"/2024/01/07/My-New-Post/","tags":[["test","/tags/test/"]],"categories":[["开发日志","/categories/%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E6%97%A5%E5%BF%97/"]],"content":"测试笔记。现在是格林威治时间 2024年1月7日，0点51分。 差不多该睡觉了，但现在小破华为突然开始播放MJ的Beat it， emmmmmmmm，exciting！ 顺便测试一些东西代码显示 简单的C语言hello world示范 内容折叠 这是一条折叠内容 你怎么能打开它不要啦！快点拉上！！！ 还不赶快拉上！ 提示面板 面板框的标题 公开处刑1号公开处刑2号 其中TYPE可以是success&#x2F;danger&#x2F;info&#x2F;warning 提示信息真的有人会看吗 应该会有人吧，，， 万一真的没有呢Σ(っ °Д °;)っ 不，一定会有人的(・∀・(・∀・(・∀・*) 别看了，说的就是你 模糊字面我不知道你能不能看得清这些东西 "},{"title":"Hello World","date":"2024-01-07T00:05:53.000Z","url":"/2024/01/07/hello-world/","categories":[["undefined",""]],"content":"Welcome to Hexo!
